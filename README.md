Efficient Neighbohood Ops
=========================

A topic from the seminar "BioImage Analysis Algorithms - Theory and Applications" mentored by Christian Dietz at the University of Konstanz.

Goal
----

 1. Benchmark existing neighborhood operations and algorithms on images in the imglib2 and imagej2-ops libraries.
 2. Find a more efficient way to do neighborhood operations
 3. Implement one or two algorithms using the new method.

The Projects
------------

 - **neighborhood-bench:** Maven project benchmarking imagej2-ops and imglib2 using the jmh benchmarking library.

*Future:*

 - **imglib2:** git submodule linked to a fork of imglib2 containing the branch in which the new neighborhood operations is going to be implemented.
 - **imagej2-ops:** git submodule linked to a fork of imagej2-ops containing the branch in which the algorithms are going to be implemented.
